Hi Jesus,

Because I needed it for some project, I wrote PHP functions giving the
cumulated standard normal distribution and its inverse.
You will find the source attached.
You may feel free to add those functions to a future version of your
PEAR
package if you deem it useful/ appropriate.
(quite basic hack - I do not claim any copyright)

Note: the names I provisionnally gave to those functions are the Excel
function names.

Best regards
Ignatius Reilly
